## Features

- **Content Creation and Sales**: Authors can publish paid articles, organized by categories such as Technology, Art, and Lifestyle. Users purchase articles using cryptocurrencies (e.g., USDC, ETH) and receive ownership in the form of NFTs.
- **Category-Based Organization**: Content is easily navigable with categories, allowing users to find relevant articles quickly.
- **Community Governance and DAO Participation**: Users can participate in platform governance, content rating, and category management through a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), ensuring transparent and democratic management.
- **Smart Contract Automation**: Handles article sales, revenue distribution, and subscription management, ensuring transparency and efficiency.
- **NFT Ownership Proof**: Articles purchased are represented as NFTs, allowing for secondary market trading and ownership transfer.
- **Token Incentive System**: Users are rewarded with tokens for contributing to content rating and categorization, promoting active participation in content management.

## Technologies Used

- **Smart Contracts**: Implemented using Solidity to handle content sales, NFT issuance, and governance.
- **Decentralized Storage**: Uses IPFS and Arweave for hosting content to ensure censorship resistance and data permanence.
- **Web3 Wallet Integration**: MetaMask and WalletConnect integration for secure payments and NFT management.
- **Oracle Services**: API3 or Chainlink used for reliable data feeds into smart contracts, enhancing transparency and accuracy in pricing and reward systems.
- **Frontend Development**: Built using React/Next.js for an intuitive and responsive user interface.
- **Backend and Database**: Node.js with Express for server-side logic, MongoDB for decentralized data storage.

## System Overview

ETHNarrative integrates multiple Web3 technologies to provide a seamless experience for both content creators and consumers. Key components include smart contracts for handling transactions and ownership, decentralized storage solutions for article hosting, and a DAO framework for community governance. The use of NFTs ensures proof of ownership and enables trading in secondary markets.
