## ETHToGo

**ETHToGo** is a decentralized, Web3-based platform designed to revolutionize the takeout and delivery industry. ETHToGo enables users to directly order takeout from local restaurants, with all transactions, payments, and reviews handled transparently through smart contracts. This platform aims to provide a more efficient, secure, and community-driven experience for both customers and restaurant owners.

## Features

- **Peer-to-Peer Takeout Orders**: ETHToGo allows users to place orders directly with local restaurants using smart contracts, eliminating the need for centralized intermediaries.
- **Token-Based Loyalty Program**: Users earn tokens for each order, which can be used for discounts, access to exclusive menu items, or traded in secondary markets.
- **Decentralized Review System**: Reviews and ratings are stored on the blockchain, ensuring they are tamper-proof and trustworthy. Only verified users who have made purchases can leave reviews.
- **Integration with BNB Chain Ecosystem**: Leverages BNB Chain's fast, low-cost transactions and Greenfield for secure data storage, providing seamless interaction with other decentralized applications.
- **Regional Tokens for Local Economies**: Specific tokens can be issued for different regions, promoting local economic growth and strengthening community ties.
- **NFT-Based Special Offers**: Restaurants can offer limited edition menu items or special promotions as NFTs, which users can purchase, trade, or redeem.

## Technologies Used

- **Blockchain**: BNB Chain for handling transactions and smart contract execution.
- **Smart Contracts**: Developed in Solidity to manage orders, payments, loyalty rewards, and governance.
- **Decentralized Storage**: Utilizes BNB Greenfield and IPFS for secure, permanent storage of menu data and order history.
- **Web3 Wallet Integration**: MetaMask and WalletConnect support for secure payment processing and NFT management.
- **Frontend Development**: Built with React.js for an interactive and user-friendly interface.
- **Backend and Database**: Node.js with Express for server-side logic, MongoDB for managing decentralized data.

## System Overview

ETHToGo integrates several Web3 technologies to create a decentralized ecosystem for food ordering. Key components include BNB Chain-based smart contracts for secure transactions, decentralized storage solutions for data integrity, and tokenomics to incentivize user engagement and loyalty. The use of NFTs enables unique customer experiences, such as special menu items and exclusive offers.
